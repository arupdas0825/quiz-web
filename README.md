## 📖 About the Project

The **Online Examination System** is a web-based quiz application developed as an academic project. It allows students to take multiple-choice exams across **6 core Computer Science subjects**, automatically calculates grades and grade points, and maintains a session-based score history.

The project is built using **React.js** with a beautiful **Glassmorphism / Liquidmorphism** UI design, featuring animated gradient backgrounds and fully responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile devices.

> 💡 This project was also implemented as a **Java Swing desktop application** (separate repository) and later upgraded to a full web application for broader accessibility.
